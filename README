The game of life is a computational algorithm designed by the mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970, in which the dynamics of a population of living creatures is simulated. 

A matrix of any size nxm is initialized with values 0 (dead cell) or 1 (living cell). 
At each step, the number of neighbours to each cell is counted, and the following rules apply:
1) If the cell is alive but the number of neighbours is below 2 (underpopulation), the cell will die.
2) If the cell is alive but the number of neighbours is above 3 (overpopulation), the cell will die.
3) f the cell is dead and the number of neighbours is exactly 3, it will become alive (reproduction). 
4) In any other case, the cell remains as it is.

By following these simple rules, we can see that a dynamics takes place in the simulation which resembles that 
of a living population. In addition, some interesting emerging behaviours appear, such as gliders, 
a sort of nomad groups which keep on moving in a straight line if nothing perturbs them. 

In my case, I chose a square matrix, whose size is hard coded. Periodic boundary conditions were applied, so that in principle an infinite universe is simulated, made of infinite copies of the unit cell.
